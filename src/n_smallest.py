'''
Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests (so, fair warning, be aware that you are not getting out of it just throwing a lame basic sorting method there) with a list of integers and the expected number n of smallest elements to return.

Also:

the number of elements to be returned cannot be higher than the list length;
elements can be duplicated;
in case of duplicates, just return them according to the original order (see third example for more clarity).
